# [**(OOBS)** -> Object Oriented Bank System.](../../README.md)

## 📜 Project Requirements.


### 📝 Notes
1. this not actuall requirments document, it's high level system functionallity document.

### 💡 Main Idea.
    Making C++ CLI Application simulate BMS (Bank Management System) with two Applications (Bank Application, ATM Application) with their functionalities.

### 🛠 Basic Functional Requirements.

    1. Banking Application.
        1. Validate login data.
        2. Match admin permissions.
        3. Show system Dashboard.
        4. Show Login log.
        5. CRUDS operations on clients.
        6. CRUDS operations on admins.
        7. Transactions functionalities.
        8. Show Transactions log.
        9. Data saved on CSV files.
    2. ATM Application.
        1. Validate login data.
        2. Show login log.
        3. Show account data.
        4. Transactions functionalities.
        5. Show Transactions log.
        6. Data saved on CSV files.

### 🧱 Basic non-Functional Requirements.
        1. Banking program.
            1. Performance -> Using C++ for more speed, and because it's a c++ tutorial ^-^.
            2. Usability -> Using very easy UI.
            3. Security -> Using encrypted password authentication.
            4. Reliability -> Every thing done accurate.
            5. Availability -> It turned off when you shut down this's the only way ^-^.
        2. ATM program.
            1. Reusability -> As we communicate with Banking program this program will have his all Advantages.
